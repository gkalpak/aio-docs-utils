## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Known issues

#### Possible inconsistency with the actual implementation

The examples in the actual docs are processed via [dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni) and more specifically using utilities in the [examples-package](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/aio/tools/transforms/examples-package).<br />
This extension re-implements the relevant logic, but might have slight inconsistencies compared to the actual `dgeni` implementation.

#### Multi-line `{@example ...}` tags not fully supported

`{@example ...}` tags spreading across multi lines, will not be recognized if there are lines that contain only unnamed attributes (such as the path or title). For example:

```
// Not recognized.
{@example
  path/to/examp.le
  region="foo"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le region="foo"
  This is the title
}

// Recognized.
{@example
  path/to/examp.le region="foo"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le region="foo"
  title="This is the title"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le
  region="foo" This is the title
}
```

## TODO

Things I want to (but won't necessarily) do:

- Add e2e tests.
- Update "Features" section in `README.md`.
- Publish.
  - Ensure `test` is run before publishing.
  - Ensure `version` field is incremented in `package.json` and a corresponding tag is created and pushed to GitHub (probably via `npm version`). E.g.:
    ```
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "preversion": "npm test",
      "version": "/* Update static files with new version in `package.json` (and `git add ...`) */",
      "postversion": "git push && git push --tags"
    }
    ```
  - Post-publish:
    - Add marketplace link in repo description/`README.md`.
    - Add latest (published) version badge in `README.md`, e.g.:
      [![Latest version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/gkalpak.aio-docs-utils.svg?color=blue&label=Latest+version&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gkalpak.aio-docs-utils)
- Refactor `CodeSnippetUtils` into separate (independently unit-testable) "parsers" for different types of tags (`HtmlTag`, `NgdocTag`, etc.), that would return `ICodeSnippetRawInfo` and `ICodeSnippetAttrInfo`.
