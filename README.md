## Features

### Code snippet utilities

The extension provides features that are useful for viewing and authoring code snippets (with source code extracted from standalone apps) in [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) API docs and guides.

#### Show code snippets on hover

Hovering over `<code-example>` or `{@example}` tags, shows the extracted code snippets, including their title and line numbering.

#### Peek/Go to code snippet definition

Right-clicking on `<code-example>` or `{@example}` tags, shows context menu options for peeking the definition (source code regions) and navigating to the definition (source code file) of the code snippet.

If the code snippet consists of multiple docregions, all regions are highlighted.

#### Autocomplete suggestions for docregions

When creating `<code-example>` or `{@example}` tags, autocomplete suggestions are shown for the `region` attribute.

_**Note**: Autocomplete suggestions are triggered by the characters `=` (after `region`) and `'`/`"` (after `region=`)._

## Known issues

#### Possible inconsistency with the actual implementation

The examples in the actual docs are processed via [dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni) and more specifically using utilities in the [examples-package](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/aio/tools/transforms/examples-package).<br />
This extension re-implements the relevant logic, but might have slight inconsistencies compared to the actual `dgeni` implementation.

#### Multi-line `{@example ...}` tags not fully supported

`{@example ...}` tags spreading across multi lines, will not be recognized if there are lines that contain only unnamed attributes (such as the path or title). For example:

```
// Not recognized.
{@example
  path/to/examp.le
  region="foo"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le region="foo"
  This is the title
}

// Recognized.
{@example
  path/to/examp.le region="foo"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le region="foo"
  title="This is the title"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le
  region="foo" This is the title
}
```

## TODO

Things I want to (but won't necessarily) do:

- Add e2e tests.
- Automate creating GitHub releases and publishing to marketplace via CI. Relevant resources:
  - https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment (esp. https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/#conditional-releases-with-on)
  - https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases
  - https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blob/e0bed901c4c1e1735582b04a39772a6f6bcb7886/.travis.yml#L52-L70 (reference implementation)
- Refactor `CodeSnippetUtils` into separate (independently unit-testable) "parsers" for different types of tags (`HtmlTag`, `NgdocTag`, etc.), that would return `ICodeSnippetRawInfo` and `ICodeSnippetAttrInfo`.
