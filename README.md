## TODO

Things I want to (but won't necessarily) do:

- Set up CI.
- Add e2e tests.
- Update "Features" section in `README.md`.
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` or "Contributing/Developing" section in `README.md`.
  - Available npm scripts (with short descriptions/purpose).
  - Available VSCode tasks and launch configurations (with short descriptions/purpose).
  - Commit message guidelines.
- Publish.
  - Ensure `test` is run before publishing.
  - Ensure `version` field is incremented in `package.json` and a corresponding tag is created and pushed to GitHub (probably via `npm version`). E.g.:
    ```
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "preversion": "npm test",
      "version": "/* Update static files with new version in `package.json` (and `git add ...`) */",
      "postversion": "git push && git push --tags"
    }
    ```
  - Post-publish:
    - Add marketplace link in repo description/`README.md`.
    - Add latest (published) version badge in `README.md`, e.g.:
      [![Latest version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/gkalpak.aio-docs-utils.svg?color=blue&label=Latest+version&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gkalpak.aio-docs-utils)
