# Angular.io Documentation Utilities

A [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension providing a set of simple utilities to aid in authoring/viewing [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/) source code.

<sub align="center">

  > _The extension is only intended for people working with the source code of the [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/) content (e.g. authors, core contributors)._

## Features

### Code snippet utilities

The extension provides features that are useful for viewing and authoring code snippets (with source code extracted from standalone apps) in [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) API docs and guides.

#### Show code snippets on hover

Hovering over `<code-example>`, `<code-pane>` or `{@example}` tags shows the extracted code snippets, including their header and line numbering.

<sub>

_**Note**: Both `header` and `title` attributes are recognized for backwards compatibility._

#### Peek/Go to code snippet definition

Right-clicking on `<code-example>`, `<code-pane>` or `{@example}` tags shows context menu options for peeking the definition (source code regions) and navigating to the definition (source code file) of the code snippet.

If the code snippet consists of multiple docregions, all regions are highlighted.

#### Autocomplete suggestions for docregions

When creating `<code-example>`, `<code-pane>` or `{@example}` tags, autocomplete suggestions are shown for the `region` attribute.

_**Note**: Autocomplete suggestions are triggered by the characters `=` (after `region`) and `'`/`"` (after `region=`)._

### Markdown preview enhancement

The extension enhances the generated previews of documentation Markdown files (mainly guides in the `aio/content/` directory and its sub-directories).

#### Fix URLs to local images

Due to how the [angular.io](https://angular.io/) build system works, the local images references in guides will be served from a `generated/images/` directory in production. During development, images are (usually) located in the `aio/src/generated/images/` directory. The extension fixes the URLs of such images in Markdown previews, so that they point to the correct image files on disk and thus correctly show up in the preview.

## Known issues

### Possible inconsistency with the actual implementation

The examples in the actual docs are processed via [dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni) and more specifically using utilities in the [examples-package](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/aio/tools/transforms/examples-package).<br />
This extension re-implements the relevant logic, but might have slight inconsistencies compared to the actual `dgeni` implementation.

### Multi-line `{@example ...}` tags not fully supported

`{@example ...}` tags spreading across multi lines will not be recognized if there are lines that contain only unnamed attributes (such as the path or header). For example:

_These **will not** be recognized:_
```
{@example
  path/to/examp.le
  region="foo"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le region="foo"
  This is the header
}
```

_These **will** be recognized:_
```
{@example
  path/to/examp.le region="foo"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le region="foo"
  header="This is the header"
}

{@example path/to/examp.le
  region="foo" This is the header
}
```

## TODO

Things I want to (but won't necessarily) do:

- Investigate/Add ability to preview app in `WebView > iframe`. E.g.:
  ```ts
  const panel = window.createWebviewPanel('foo', 'Hello, world!', ViewColumn.Active, {
    enableScripts: true,
    retainContextWhenHidden: true,
  });
  panel.webview.html = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

      <head>
        <style>
          html, body {
            margin: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
            padding: 0;
          }

          iframe {
            border: none;
            height: 100vh;
            width: 100vw;
          }
        </style>
      </head>

      <body>
        <iframe src="http://localhost:4200/"></iframe>
      </body>

    </html>
  `;
  ```

- Add e2e tests.
- Add tests for `src/test/helpers/e2e-runner.ts`.
- Consider using `webpack` for start-up time (and overall perf?) improvement.

- Investigate switching from AppVeyor to Travis for testing on Windows (once https://travis-ci.community/t/windows-instances-hanging-before-install/250 has been resolved).
- Refactor `CodeSnippetUtils` into separate (independently unit-testable) "parsers" for different types of tags (`HtmlTag`, `NgdocTag`, etc.), that would return `ICodeSnippetRawInfo` and `ICodeSnippetAttrInfo`.
